<h3 align="center">anime.nu - <i>structure anime watching</i></h3>
<br>

anime.nu is a barebones rewrite of [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) in [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell).

## Features
- Playing anime
- that's it

## Installation
Make `anime.nu` executable and copy it into to some directory present
in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Why?
Because I wanted to learn more about nushell and exercise my web API/scraping
knowledge.
